This module implements various crossover methods

# classical one point crossover: takes the two nets and divide them in two parts
# each first part is attached to the second part of the other net and we obtain two new nets
# obviously we need to modify (in general) the number of connections of the two new nets in the point
# where the original one are splitted (and eventually re-normalize the weights in those points)
# takes as input
#   net1, the first net (DeepNet object)
#   net2, the second net (DeepNet object)
#   p, the probability that the crossover happens (this one is usually much bigger than the mutation  probability, e.g. 50%)

    # scelgo a 'random' il punto di split

    # aggiusto i pesi e i bias (avr√≤ ragionevolmente delle dimensioni che mismatchano)
