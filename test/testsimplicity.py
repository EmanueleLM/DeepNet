Looking for a solution that does not involve an explicit research in the hp space
 for the problem presented in [Schmidhuber, JÃ¼rgen. "Discovering neural nets with
 low Kolmogorov complexity and high generalization capability." Neural Networks 
 10.5 (1997): 857-873]
 
The problem setting is the following: x \in X is a {0, 1}^{100} vector with 3 
 bits set to 1 (i.e. |X| = (100  3) which is about 160K), while Y is the sum of
 set-in bits (i.e. y=3 \forall x). We assume real weights while in the paper it
 is assumed to be integres from -10K to +10K. Let's see what happens.
